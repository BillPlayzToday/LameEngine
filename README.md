# Lame Engine
## What's this?
A low/mid-performing 2D engine using plain javascript.
## Hosted Example
A live-hosted example can be found [on my website right here](https://billplayz.de/page/lame-engine).
## How to install
`import` the following url into your `type="module"` loaded script:

    https://billplayz.de/function/jsdn/raw?file=BillPlayzToday/LameEngine/main/src/main.js
*You can of course use any other JavaScript Delivery Service. In this case I've used my own.*
You can **NOT** use the [raw.githubusercontent.com variant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillPlayzToday/LameEngine/main/src/main.js) without any other modifications, as GitHub unfortunately responds to raw-code requests with the "*Content-Type*" Header set to "*text/plain*", which is usually automatically declined as it is not a "*javascript/application*" value
## How to use (Docs)
*The docs can be found [right here](https://github.com/BillPlayzToday/LameEngine/blob/main/DOCS.md).*
